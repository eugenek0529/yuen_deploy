The motivation behind developing this website stemmed from numerous customer requests seeking information. 
The primary goal was to address customer inquiries efficiently by providing a comprehensive repository of the information they commonly sought. 
Additionally, I saw this project as an opportunity to delve into the realms of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
thereby gaining exposure and learning more about front-end development. 

The website is designed to be static, eliminating the need for a database connection, and will be hosted on GitHub to facilitate easy accessibility and sharing.

This project was planned by few phases including: 
* Gathering info + photography
* Design
* Implementation
* Deployment

During the design phase, I utilized tool called Figma to orange elements
